## Issue Solved: Creating a Wiki

In this Sprint, we came up with our project, our project requirements, project analysis, and started on the design.

These documents can be viewed on our wiki, which is made up of 9 section:
- Home
- Business Goals
- Effort Estimate
- Initial Architecture
- Potential Risks
- Project Goals
- Team Charter
- Technology Plan
- User Information
